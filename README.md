# PCA on African Data

This repository contains a **Google Colab notebook** demonstrating **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on a dataset of African data. The notebook walks through the **entire PCA workflow**, from data loading and standardization to dimensionality reduction and visualization.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `AfricanData.csv` – The dataset used for analysis (numeric columns only).  
- `PCA_Analysis.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook implementing PCA step by step.  
- `README.md` – This file.

## 📝 About PCA

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a statistical technique used to **reduce the dimensionality** of a dataset while preserving as much variance as possible. It helps to:

- Identify patterns in data  
- Remove redundant features  
- Visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D  

---

## 🚀 Steps Covered in the Notebook

1. **Load and Standardize Data** – Convert data into a standardized numeric form.  
2. **Compute Covariance Matrix** – Understand relationships between features.  
3. **Perform Eigendecomposition** – Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  
4. **Sort Principal Components** – Rank components based on explained variance.  
5. **Project Data** – Reduce dimensions by projecting onto top principal components.  
6. **Visualize Data** – Compare original and reduced datasets.

## 💻 How to Run

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
2. Click **File → Open notebook → GitHub**.  
3. Paste the repository URL or search for this repo.  
4. Run all cells to perform PCA and visualize results.

## 📊 Results

- The notebook produces a **reduced dataset** with top principal components.  
- Visualizations show **before-and-after dimensionality reduction**.
